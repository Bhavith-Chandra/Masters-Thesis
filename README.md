# Thesis: Behavioral Causal Discovery 

This repository contains the systematic derivation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for behavioral health using the GLOBEM dataset.

## Core Content
- **[Behavioral Causal Thesis Atlas.ipynb](notebooks/Behavioral%20Causal%20Thesis%20Atlas.ipynb)**: The primary research notebook documenting the 8-phase discovery process.
- **[Behavioral_Causal_Thesis_Atlas_Executed.ipynb](notebooks/Behavioral_Causal_Thesis_Atlas_Executed.ipynb)**: Pre-rendered version with all plots and results.

## Key Features
- **16-Variable DAG**: High-granularity structural model of behavioral mechanics.
- **8-Phase Workflow**: Empirical justification from 11,040 features to a structural model.
- **Protocol Adherence**: 5-line-per-cell discipline with deep scientific interpretation.

## Research Team
- **Researcher**: Bhavith Chandra
- **Project**: Masters Thesis on Causal Behavioral Discovery
